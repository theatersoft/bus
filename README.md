# bus
This message bus is the foundation of the Theatersoft platform. Within the platform it manages communication between host Node.js servers and client web browsers, creating a complex distributed application using modern Javascript. The initial Theatersoft application is a home monitoring, control, automation, and surveillance system, however the message bus is designed to be general purpose. For example, other possible uses include: real time chat apps between multiple browsers; connecting web apps to native host server APIs; and embedded browser based applications for automotive, consumer, and industrial markets.
